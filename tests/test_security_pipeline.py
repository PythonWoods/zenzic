"""Security pipeline regression tests.

Covers two bugs discovered during Z204 red-teaming (v0.9.0):

1. **i18n Path Bug** (Fase 1): `_locale_path_remap` in `scanner.py` was
   remapping `report.file_path` but not `report.security_findings[*].file_path`,
   causing `_map_credential_to_finding` to produce `docs//home/...` absolute
   paths when a Z204/Z201 finding was detected in an i18n file.

2. **Security Short-Circuit** (Fase 2): When a report had `security_findings`,
   structural findings (`report.findings`, `report.rule_findings`) derived from
   a partially-processed file state were still emitted, producing false positives
   like Z302 dead-definitions on files aborted mid-pipeline.
