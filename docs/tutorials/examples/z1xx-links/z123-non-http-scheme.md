## Z123 Non-HTTP Scheme

**Severity:** `note` | **Category:** `informational` | **Penalty:** `0.0 pts`

`Z123` is triggered when an `<a>` tag uses a non-standard protocol scheme (e.g., `mailto:`, `tel:`, `ftp:`).

## Why it matters

While valid, these links cannot be verified for integrity by Zenzic's static analyzer. They are flagged as notes so reviewers are aware of unverified external dependencies.

## Remediation

This is an informational finding and carries no DQS penalty. No immediate action is required unless the scheme is unintentional.
