# ADR 007: Sovereign Sandbox

## Context

When analyzing and parsing external data or configuration, the system must prevent unexpected privilege escalation or side effects.

## Decision

Isolate the analysis runtime to prevent privilege escalation.

## Rationale

Restricting the analysis to a sovereign sandbox guarantees that external inputs cannot alter the host system state or access unauthorized resources.

## Invariants

- Analysis runtime must be fully isolated.
- Zero capability for privilege escalation during execution.

## Consequences

- Tighter security envelope around the analyzer.
- Increased complexity in bridging data across the sandbox boundary.
