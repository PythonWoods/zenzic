"""Zenzic Rule Engine — pluggable, pure-function linting rules.

Architecture
------------
Rules are pure functions: they receive immutable data (file path, line text,
line number) and return a list of :class:`RuleFinding` objects.  No I/O is
permitted inside a rule — this is enforced by the interface contract and
documented clearly.

Two kinds of rules coexist in the same engine:

* **CustomRule** — declared directly in ``.zenzic.toml`` as ``[[custom_rules]]``
  entries.  No Python required.  Ideal for project-specific vocabulary checks.
* **BaseRule** subclasses — Python classes registered via the
  ``zenzic.rules`` entry-point group.  For complex, multi-line logic that
  a regex cannot express.

Both kinds are applied through the same :class:`AdaptiveRuleEngine.run` interface so
the scanner only sees one surface.

Rule dependency taxonomy (🔌 Dev 3 — relevant for caching)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Rules divide into two classes based on their input dependencies.  This
determines which cache-key components are required (see
:mod:`zenzic.core.cache`):

**Atomic rules** — depend only on the content of a single file and the
active configuration.  Cache key: ``SHA256(content) + SHA256(config)``.
These cache entries survive VSM changes caused by *other* files.

Examples:

* :class:`CustomRule` — regex applied line-by-line; no cross-file state.
* Any :class:`BaseRule` subclass whose :meth:`check` inspects only ``text``.

**Global rules** — depend on the VSM (routing table) in addition to file
content and configuration.  Cache key:
``SHA256(content) + SHA256(config) + SHA256(vsm_snapshot)``.  These entries
are invalidated whenever *any* file's routing state changes.

Examples:

* :class:`VSMBrokenLinkRule` — validates links against ``vsm[url].status``.
* Any :class:`BaseRule` subclass that overrides :meth:`check_vsm` and
  consults the ``vsm`` or ``anchors_cache`` arguments.

**Cross-file rules** (future) — depend on the content of *other* files, not
just the routing state.  These cannot be cached per-file without a
file-level dependency graph and must be treated as always-invalidated.
No built-in rules of this type exist yet.

Zenzic Way compliance
---------------------
* **Lint the Source:** Rules receive raw Markdown text — never HTML.
* **No Subprocesses:** The rule module does not import or invoke any process.
* **Pure Functions First:** :meth:`BaseRule.check` must be deterministic and
  side-effect-free.  :class:`AdaptiveRuleEngine.run` is also pure (list in, list out).

    Subclasses that need to validate links against the routing table should
    override :meth:`check_vsm` instead of (or in addition to) :meth:`check`.
    The engine calls :meth:`check_vsm` when a :data:`~zenzic.models.vsm.VSM`

    The filesystem tells you *whether* a file exists.  The VSM tells you
